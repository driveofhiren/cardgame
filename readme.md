Sure! Here are the rules of **Judgement** in simple text:

### Judgement Game Rules

**Objective**: Earn points by predicting how many rounds you can win.

**Game Setup**:

-   Host a game with desired players
-   Remaining players have to join game through that Room Id.
-   Players are dealt a hand of cards.
-   Each player sets a target for how many rounds they think they can win.

**Target Setting**:

-   Players take turns setting their targets.
-   The total of all targets cannot equal the total number of cards.
-   The last player must avoid making the total equal to the number of cards.

**Playing Cards**:

-   Players play one card per round. The first card determines the lead suit.
-   Players must follow the lead suit if they can; otherwise, they can play any card.
-   If there's no lead suit, the first player can choose any card.

**Master Suit**:

-   A "Master Suit" is chosen at the start of each round and is stronger than other suits.

**Winning a Round**:

-   The player with the highest-ranked card of the lead suit wins the round, unless a Master Suit card is played.

**Scoring**:

-   If a player wins the exact number of rounds they predicted, they earn points equal to their target plus a 10-point bonus.
-   Players are ranked by their total points at the end.

**End of Game**:

-   The game continues until each player has only 1 card left. Ties can occur.

Feel free to adjust any part of this as needed!
